# Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

The security of RAMSDAO’s smart contracts are importance to us. For that reason, we have a bug bounty program to incentivize responsible bug disclosure.

## Scope

The bounty program is for smart contract vulnerability disclosures only and contains the following:

| Smart Contract | Features             | Open Source Code |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| rambank.eos    | Lease Contracts      |                  |
| ramx.eos       | Order Book Contracts |                  |
| newrams.eos    | RAMS Token Contract  |                  |

## Eligibility

To be eligible for a reward under this program, you must:

- Discover an unreported, non-public vulnerability that is not previously known by the team and within the scope of this Program.

- Provide sufficient information so that our engineers can reproduce and fix the vulnerability.

- Not exploit the vulnerability in any way, including making it public or exploiting profits.

- Not one of our current or former employees, or a vendor or contractor who has been involved in the code development.

## Rewards

Rewards will be given based on the above severity level as well as the likelihood of the bug being triggered or exploited. The final decision is determined by RAMSDAO. 

- High impact｜Rewards：\$ 20,000-\$50,000

Issues that could impact many users and have serious reputational, legal, or financial risks. An example would be being able to lock contracts permanently or take funds from all users.

Medium impact｜Rewards：\$5,000-\$20,000

> Issues that impact individual users where exploitation would cause reputational, legal, or moderate financial risk to the user.

- Low impact｜Rewards：\$1,000-\$5,000

> Smaller losses impacting only individual users, or specific tokens, or specific chains.

## Disclosure

Any vulnerability or bug discovered must be reported only to the following email: support@ramseos.io

The vulnerability must not be disclosed publicly or to any other person, entity, or email address before our team has been notified, has fixed the issue, and has granted permission for public disclosure. In addition, disclosure must be made within 24 hours after the discovery of the vulnerability.

A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward and may increase the reward amount. Please provide as much information about the vulnerability as possible, including:

The conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent.

The steps needed to reproduce the bug.

The potential implications of the vulnerability being abused.

Summary

By submitting your report, you grant RAMSDAO any and all rights, including intellectual property rights, needed to validate, mitigate, and disclose the vulnerability. All reward decisions, including eligibility for and amounts of the rewards and the manner in which such rewards will be paid, are made by RAMSDAO.

The terms and conditions of this program may be altered at any time.

# 漏洞賞金計劃

## 概述

RAMSDAO智能合約的安全性對我們來說至關重要，因此，我們製定了【漏洞賞金計劃】以激勵負責任的漏洞披露。

## 範圍

該賞金計劃僅針對智能合約的漏洞披露，包含以下：

| 智能合約    | 主要功能     | 開源代碼 |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| rambank.eos | 租賃合約     |          |
| ramx.eos    | 掛單合約     |          |
| newrams.eos | RAMS代幣合約 |          |

## 資格

為了獲得漏洞賞金獎勵的資格，需要滿足以下條件：

- 發現以前未報告的、未公開的漏洞，該漏洞以前不為團隊所知，並且屬於此計劃的範圍內。

- 請提供足夠的信息，以便我們的工程師能夠重現和修復此漏洞。

- 不是我們的現任或前任員工，也不是參與開發相關 bug 代碼的供應商或承包商。

- 不得以任何方式利用漏洞，包括通過公開漏洞或獲取利潤。

## 獎勵

獎勵將根據嚴重性等級以及漏洞被觸發或利用的可能性給予，付款以USDT支付，具體由RAMSDAO自行決定。

- 高影響｜獎勵：\$ 20,000-\$50,000

> 可能影響眾多用戶並具有嚴重聲譽、法律或財務影響的問題。例如能夠永久鎖定合約或從所有用戶那裏獲取資金。

- 中等影響｜獎勵：\$5,000-\$20,000

> 影響個人用戶的問題，其中利用會給用戶帶來聲譽、法律或中等財務風險。

- 低影響｜獎勵：\$1,000-\$5,000

> 較小的損失，僅影響個人用戶、特定代幣或特定鏈。

## 披露

發現的任何漏洞或錯誤必須僅報告給以下電子郵件：support@ramseos.io

在通知、修復問題並授予公開披露許可之前，不得公開披露漏洞，或向任何其他個人、實體或電子郵件地址披露漏洞。此外，必須在發現漏洞後 24 小時內進行披露。

漏洞的詳細報告會增加獲得獎勵的可能性，並可能增加獎勵金額。請提供盡可能多的有關漏洞的信息，包括：重現 Bug 的條件、重現Bug所需的步驟、漏洞被濫用的潛在影響。

## 總結

提交報告，即表示您授予RAMSDAO 驗證、緩解和披露漏洞所需的任何和所有權利，包括知識產權。

所有獎勵決定，包括獎勵的資格和金額以及此類獎勵的支付方式，均由 RAMSDAO 自行決定。本計劃的條款和條件可能隨時更改。
